What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?  List and explain at least FOUR advantages in using a CDN.

A content delivery network is a large distributed system of servers deployed in multiple data centers across the Internet.

1. Files may be pre-cached therefore, the file has already been cached by your browser and won’t need to be downloaded again.
2. It’s usually possible to link to a specific version of a CSS file or         JavaScript library. You can often request the “latest” version if           required.
3. Many CDNs provide localized data centers which are closer to the user       and result in faster downloads.
4. A CDN can distribute the load, save bandwidth, boost performance and reduce your existing hosting costs — often for free.
